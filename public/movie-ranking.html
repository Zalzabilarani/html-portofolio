<h3>'Castle' nothing to howl about</h3>

<p>Almost the first sight we see in "Howl's Moving Castle" is the castle itself, which looks as if it were hammered together in shop class by wizards inspired by the lumbering, elephantine war machines in "The Empire Strikes Back." The castle is an amazing visual invention, a vast collection of turrets and annexes, protuberances and afterthoughts, which makes its way across the landscape like a turtle in search of a rumble. I settled back in my seat, confident that Japan's Hayao Miyazaki had once again created his particular kind of animated magic, and that the movie would deserve comparison with "Spirited Away," "Princess Mononoke," "My Neighbor Totoro," "Kiki's Delivery Service" and the other treasures of the most creative animator in the history of the art form.</p>

<h3>Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba Tanjiro Kamado, Unwavering Resolve Arc</h3>

<p>In the Taisho era of Japan, Kamado Tanjiro, a soft-hearted boy who lives by selling charcoal. However, his peaceful life suddenly collapses when a demon slaughters his entire family. Only Nezuko, one of his younger sisters, survives. The problem is, Nezuko turned into a demon. In order to turn Nezuko back into a human and avenge his family, Tanjiro is determined to pursue his path as a demon slayer.</p>

<h3>When Marnie Was There</h3>

<p>It’s impossible to watch “When Marnie Was There” and not consider it as something of an elegy for Studio Ghibli. This tender, earnest melodrama will be the last film from the legendary animation studio for the foreseeable future, and its themes of friendship, fantasy, and a quest for emotional strength fit snugly in the Ghibli canon. Ultimately, the second film from Hiromasa Yonebayashi (“The Secret World of Arriety”) may feel like minor Ghibli, but it is also final Ghibli, which gives it added, but undeniable, emotional resonance that it may otherwise lack. “When Marnie Was There” is a sweet tale about learning to embrace our tragic pasts and differences not so we fit in but so we are comfortable on our own. It is filled with the luscious, beautiful 2D animation that we’ve come to expect from Ghibli, and if the storytelling sometimes gets a bit lethargic for its own good, we’re more forgiving just to have one final dance in the moonlight.</p>
